# Brick Breaker Blitz

# 🛑Introduction
 The Brick Breaker Game is a classic arcade-style game developed using OpenGL and
 C++. The game challenges players to control a paddle at the bottom of the screen,
 preventing a bouncing ball from falling while breaking bricks positioned at the top. With
 simple yet engaging gameplay, players must use quick reflexes and strategic movement to
 clear all the bricks and advance through levels. The game includes multiple levels, each
 increasing in difficulty by adding more bricks and increasing the ball’s speed. Players have
 a limited number of chances to keep the ball in play. The game also tracks the score,
 highest score, and previous scores, encouraging players to beat their own records. By
 utilizing OpenGL, the game efficiently handles rendering, physics, and user interactions,
 making it a great example of how computer graphics and game mechanics work together
 to create an interactive experience.

 # ⚒Objectives
  The primary objectives of the game are as follows:
 1 To design an interactive game where players control a ball to hit and break bricks
 while keeping it from dropping off the screen.
 2 To integrate the OpenGL graphics library for rendering smooth, dynamic visuals,
 including the ball, paddle, and brick structures.
 3 To develop a system that tracks and displays player scores, fostering competition
 and improving the gaming experience.
 4 Toimplement advanced collision detection algorithms to ensure realistic and precise
 interactions between the ball, paddle, and bricks.
 5 Toestablish a continuous game loop that consistently updates the game’s logic and
 renders graphics for a seamless gaming experience.

# 🔑Working Principle
1)Game Start: The game begins when the player clicks the mouse and the ball starts moving on the screen.
2)Ball Movement: The ball moves automatically and bounces off walls, the bar and bricks.
3)Bar Control: The player moves the bar left or right using arrow keys or the mouse to keep the ball from falling.
4)Brick Collision: When the ball hits a brick, the brick breaks and the player earns points.
5)Score Update: The score is updated and displayed in real-time whenever bricks are broken.
6)Chances Lost: If the ball falls off the screen, one chance is lost. The game ends when all chances are used.
7)Level Progression: When all bricks in a level are destroyed, the next level begins with increased difficulty.
8)Real-Time Interface: The screen continuously updates to show the ball, bar, bricks, score, remaining chances, highest score and current level.
9)Game Over or Completion: The game ends when the player either completes all levels or loses all chances and appropriate messages are displayed.
